# Project-C12: Carbon-Aware Model Router - Masterplan

## 📋 Project Overview
Project-C12 is an innovative solution that dynamically routes AI inference requests to the most carbon-efficient model based on real-time carbon intensity, task complexity, and user preferences.

## 🎯 Core Objectives
1. Reduce carbon footprint of AI inference
2. Provide transparent environmental impact metrics
3. Maintain optimal performance while being eco-conscious
4. Create an extensible architecture for future enhancements

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### 1. Backend (FastAPI)
- **Carbon Service**: Real-time carbon intensity data fetcher
- **Model Registry**: Manages available models and their metadata
- **Routing Engine**: Decision logic for model selection
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful interface for inference requests

### 2. Frontend (Streamlit)
- **User Interface**: Clean, intuitive dashboard
- **Real-time Metrics**: Carbon intensity and savings visualization
- **Query Interface**: User input and response display

### 3. Infrastructure
- **Docker Containers**: Isolated services
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Performance and carbon metrics tracking
