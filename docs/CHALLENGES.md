# üéØ Project-C12: Development Challenges & Solutions

This document outlines the key challenges encountered during the development of Project-C12 and how they were addressed.

## ü§ñ Model Management

### 1. Memory Optimization
- **Challenge**: Loading multiple large language models (TinyLlama, CodeLlama, GPT-2) simultaneously consumed excessive memory
- **Solution**: Implemented on-demand model loading with caching
  - TinyLlama loaded at startup as default model
  - Other models loaded only when needed
  - Models cached after first load
  - Memory usage reduced significantly

### 2. Code Detection
- **Challenge**: Accurately identifying code-related queries to route to CodeLlama
- **Solution**: Developed a sophisticated query analysis system
  - Pattern matching for code indicators
  - Keyword-based scoring system
  - Context-aware routing logic

## üìä Performance & Scaling

### 1. Response Time
- **Challenge**: High latency when switching between models
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented model caching
  - Added request queuing system
  - Optimized model quantization (4-bit)

### 2. Resource Management
- **Challenge**: Balancing resource usage with carbon efficiency
- **Solution**:
  - Dynamic model selection based on:
    - Query complexity
    - Current carbon intensity
    - Available system resources
  - Implemented graceful degradation

## üåê System Integration

### 1. Data Consistency
- **Challenge**: Maintaining consistent metrics across API and dashboard
- **Solution**: 
  - Centralized metrics database
  - Implemented symlinks for unified data access
  - Added data validation layers

### 2. Monitoring Infrastructure
- **Challenge**: Real-time tracking of system performance and carbon metrics
- **Solution**: 
  - Integrated Prometheus for metrics collection
  - Added Grafana dashboards for visualization
  - Implemented custom metrics endpoints

## üîÑ Carbon Awareness

### 1. Real-time Carbon Data
- **Challenge**: Obtaining accurate, real-time carbon intensity data
- **Solution**:
  - Integrated with carbon intensity APIs
  - Implemented local caching
  - Added fallback data sources

### 2. Model Selection Logic
- **Challenge**: Balancing performance requirements with carbon efficiency
- **Solution**: 
  - Developed scoring system considering:
    - Carbon intensity
    - Query complexity
    - Model performance
    - Response time requirements

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Deployment

### 1. Docker Configuration
- **Challenge**: Managing multiple services with different requirements
- **Solution**:
  - Created separate Dockerfiles for each service
  - Implemented docker-compose for orchestration
  - Added health checks and auto-restart policies

### 2. Testing Infrastructure
- **Challenge**: Testing model behavior and carbon-aware decisions
- **Solution**:
  - Created mock carbon intensity data
  - Implemented integration tests
  - Added performance benchmarking suite

## üîç Future Challenges

1. **Scaling**
   - Handling increased user load
   - Managing multiple model versions
   - Optimizing resource allocation

2. **Model Evolution**
