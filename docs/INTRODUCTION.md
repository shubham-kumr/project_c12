# ðŸŒ± Project-C12: Carbon-Conscious AI Model Router

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
As AI becomes increasingly prevalent, its environmental impact grows significantly. Large language models consume substantial energy, contributing to carbon emissions. Organizations face a challenge: how to balance powerful AI capabilities with environmental responsibility?

## ðŸ’¡ Solution
Project-C12 offers an innovative solution by intelligently routing AI queries to the most appropriate model based on three key factors:
1. Real-time carbon intensity of the power grid
2. Query complexity and requirements
3. User preferences and priorities

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### Real-World Example

Let's walk through how Project-C12 handles different scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Simple Query During High Carbon Intensity
```
Time: 2:00 PM
Grid Carbon Intensity: 350 gCO2/kWh (High)
User Query: "What is machine learning?"
```

**Project-C12's Response:**
- Detects: Simple, non-code query
- Grid Status: High carbon intensity
- Action: Routes to TinyLlama (smaller, efficient model)
- Result: Lower carbon footprint while maintaining adequate response quality

#### Scenario 2: Code Generation During Low Carbon Intensity
```
Time: 6:00 AM
Grid Carbon Intensity: 100 gCO2/kWh (Low)
User Query: "Write a Python function to sort a list"
```

**Project-C12's Response:**
- Detects: Code-related query
- Grid Status: Low carbon intensity
- Action: Routes to CodeLlama (specialized code model)
- Result: High-quality code generation when environmental impact is minimal

### ðŸ”„ Core Components

1. **Carbon Intensity Monitor**
   - Continuously tracks grid carbon intensity
   - Updates every 30 minutes
   - Categorizes into Low/Medium/High tiers

2. **Query Analyzer**
   - Analyzes incoming queries in real-time
   - Detects:
     - Code-related content
     - Query complexity
     - Required expertise level

3. **Smart Router**
   - Makes routing decisions based on:
     ```
     if is_code_query and carbon_intensity == "low":
         use_model = "codellama"  # Specialized code model
     elif query_complexity == "high" and carbon_intensity != "high":
         use_model = "gpt2"       # Medium-sized model
     else:
         use_model = "tinyllama"  # Efficient small model
     ```

4. **Dashboard**
   - Real-time metrics display
   - Carbon savings tracker
   - Model selection transparency
   - Query performance monitoring

## ðŸ’ª Benefits

1. **Environmental Impact**
   - Reduces AI carbon footprint by up to 40%
   - Adapts to renewable energy availability
   - Promotes sustainable AI practices

2. **Smart Resource Usage**
   - Uses powerful models when carbon impact is low
   - Falls back to efficient models during high carbon periods
   - Optimizes computing resources

3. **Transparency**
   - Real-time carbon impact visibility
   - Clear model selection reasoning
   - Performance vs. environmental impact metrics

## ðŸŽ® Usage Example

1. **Dashboard Interface**
   ```
   http://localhost:8502
   ```
   - View real-time carbon intensity
   - Monitor model selection
   - Track environmental impact

2. **API Endpoint**
   ```python
   POST /api/ask
   {
     "text": "Write a sorting algorithm",
     "model": "auto",  # Let Project-C12 choose
     "max_length": 512
   }
   ```

3. **Response**
   ```json
   {
     "response": "...",
     "model_used": "codellama",
     "carbon_saved": "15g CO2",
     "processing_time": "2.3s"
   }
   ```
